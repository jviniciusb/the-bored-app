# The Bored App
A very simple Android/Kotlin project that is a client to [The Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/) and is intended to be used as part of an Android/Kotlin training.

The project is purposely left incomplete so it can finished together with the participants of the Android/Kotlin training.
The project would be used to explain some topics like dependency injection using [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) and unit tests with [Mockk](https://mockk.io/), alongside with some Android/Kotlin concepts.
